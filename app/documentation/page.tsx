        <p className="mt-2">
        MyHeartRisk is an AI-driven tool for patients to monitor their risk of ACS, developed as part of a study in Malaysia in collaboration with Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) and Universiti Malaya (UM). It leverages data from the National Cardiovascular Disease (NCVD) Malaysia registry to build an ACS risk prediction model. 
        By integrating with MeldRx or functioning as a standalone app, MyHeartRisk delivers real-time ACS risk scores, categorized risk levels, and personalized health insights. The model is based on clinical research and data-driven methodologies, contributing to improved early detection and preventive care for cardiovascular diseases.
        Here are some work builds upon studies in cardiovascular risk assessment by us, including:

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why MyHeartRisk Matters in Healthcare & EHR</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
        ACS risk prediction is crucial because Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of heart-related emergencies and deaths, and early detection can significantly reduce mortality and complications. By leveraging AI-powered risk assessment, MyHeartRisk helps identify high-risk patients before symptoms appear, allowing for preventive strategies such as lifestyle modifications, medication adjustments, and closer monitoring. This proactive approach not only improves patient care but also reduces hospital readmissions, healthcare costs, and the burden on emergency services, making it a valuable tool for modern cardiovascular healthcare.
        Integrating MyHeartRisk with Meldrx enhances clinical decision-making by providing real-time ACS risk predictions directly within existing workflows. EHR integration ensures that healthcare providers have seamless access to a patientâ€™s medical history, risk factors, and AI-driven insights without disrupting their workflow. This leads to more informed, data-driven decisions, enabling early intervention and better patient outcomes.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">How to Try MyHeartRisk</h2>
        <p>Developing MyHeartRisk came with several challenges, especially as I navigated new concepts and technologies:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
          <li><strong>First Time Working with EHR and MeldRx</strong> â€“ This was my first experience with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and the MeldRx platform, requiring a steep learning curve to understand how data flows and integrates within clinical environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Issues with Loading Provided Patient Data</strong> â€“ The provided patient XML file did not load correctly, forcing me to manually code a patient XML file with the help of LLMs. The app might not work properly with other patient as the XML structure might be different. Please use the patient xml provided.</li>
          <li><strong>First Time Dealing with FHIR Standard</strong> â€“ Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is a complex framework with strict data formatting rules. Understanding FHIR resources, profiles, and how to query data required significant effort.</li>
        </ul>
